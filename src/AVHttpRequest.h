/** Http Request
 An http request is a simple object that makes it easy to download or send data over the internet. It supports both async and sync loading of data.
 When using async you are able to pause or cancel the request while its ongoing. Synchronous downlods cannot be paused or cancelled - they have
 to complete fully.

 The HttpRequest object supports sending arguments over POST and changing HTTP headers.
 
 The HttpRequest object is also capable of estimating time left of he current download.

/** Delegate
A delegate class that implements AVVHttpRequestProtocol to get notifications when events happens. See AVHttpRequestProtocol for a list of events.

/** Arguments
A key/value store of arguments to pass along as body for the request

A key/value store of optional headers to send with he request
*/

/** Type
Specifies if the request should be sync or async

ASYNC
    The request is loaded in a background thread, everytime something happens the delegate is called. Async requests can be cancelled or paused

SYNC
    The request is loaded on the current thread block all other activities. As soon as you call [request start] the thread blocks untill the request is done.
    When the request starts it calls its delegate didStartRequest:(AVHttpRequest*)request, and when it finishes it either calls didFailRequest:(AVHttpRequest *)request or didFinishHttpRequest:(AVHttpRequest*)request withResponse:(AVHttpResponse*)response;

    If you don't add a delegate you can always get the repsonse throigh request.response property
